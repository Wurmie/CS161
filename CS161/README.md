What it does:

This lab should convert binary to BCD with unsigned add/subtract as well as signed add/subtract

Problems:

The code is not dividing properly and the compiler is not accepting the new library to divide as well. We put the arith library and it gave us more errors. 

Alot of the times, the code will not even compile as it says that it cannot be linked to compiler. Not sure how to fix unless we restart the computer.
