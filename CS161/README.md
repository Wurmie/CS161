What it does:

This lab will ask you two options: convert from fixed point to floating point or from floating point to a fixed number. You are asked 2 inputs. The first is which place the decimal should be placed left of and the second is the number to be converted. 

How to use:

When asked what you want to do, 1 would yield floating to fixed and 0 would yield fixed to floating. To input the numbers, you have to input the first number, ENTER, enter the second number, ENTER.

Problems:

The code does not properly handle negatives as of now
